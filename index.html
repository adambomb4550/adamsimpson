      <p>My favorite color is <a href="https://goo.gl/images/LbqRjQ">light blue</a>. It's the perfect color. You see it all the time, such as when you look at the sky or at clear water. It's just a happy color. I also like <a href="https://goo.gl/images/TFrTqB"> light green</a> for almost the same reasons. Green and blue go together so well. I also like <a href="https://goo.gl/images/g5E47e"> dark yellow</a> because of the vibe I get from it. It makes more happy and energetic. I feel more connected to nature with these three colors
